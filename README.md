SUPER PONG!

Have you ever wanted to play a classic old game with friends, but don't want to share a screen? Welcome to Super Pong! The idea is to recreate one of the most classic games of all time, but with an added twist: This Pong will have the classic single person mode, but also an option to play with two people, locally or from different devices.

Key Features:
 - Login to Save Progress
 - Single Player
 - Multi-Player on a Single Keyboard
 - Real-Time Play Against Other Players
 - Settings to Change Background and Ball Color
 - Possible Power Ups

Simon Project Notes:
This project is interesting. It is relatively simple. The biggest challenge I think is connecting input and outputs.
