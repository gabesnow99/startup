This is the actual startup project.

SUPER PONG!

Elevator Pitch:
The idea is to recreate one of the most classic games of all time: Pong! This version will have an added twist: There will be the classic single person mode, but there will be the option to play with two people, locally or from different devices.

Key Features:
 - Login to Save Progress
 - Single Player
 - Multi-Player on a Single Keyboard
 - Real-Time Play Against Other Players
 - Settings to Change Background and Ball Color
 - Possible Power Ups
