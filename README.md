SUPER PONG!

Have you ever wanted to play a classic old game with friends, but don't want to share a screen? Welcome to Super Pong! The idea is to recreate one of the most classic games of all time, but with an added twist: This Pong will have the classic single person mode, but also an option to play with two people, locally or from different devices.

Key Features:
 - Login to Save Progress
 - Single Player
 - Multi-Player on a Single Keyboard
 - Real-Time Play Against Other Players
 - Settings to Change Background and Ball Color
 - Possible Power Ups

Simon Project Notes:
- From HTML: This project is interesting. It is relatively simple. The biggest challenge I think is connecting input and outputs. Other than that, it seems like HTML is a matter of simply knowing which building blocks to use and making a correct use of them.
- From CSS: I wondered where the heck the different styles were coming from until I followed the link that's put into the 'head' section. I realized that all of the possible formats are defined very compactly in the file. They are then imported like a package. Also, placing the link there allows the rest of the file to call the different fonts, alignments, etc. Finally, I realized that the "class=" section can include multiple components so some features can be shared and others not between elements.
